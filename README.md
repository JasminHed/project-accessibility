# Accessibility Quiz
**Live Demo:** [https://accessquiz.netlify.app](https://accessquiz.netlify.app/)  

An educational quiz application focused on web accessibility principles and inclusive design. This project was built with accessibility as a core requirement, teaching users about disability and how it affects web experiences. Creating this app deepened my understanding of accessible web development and the importance of building inclusive digital experiences for all users.

## The Problem
I wanted to create an interactive educational tool to **teach web accessibility principles**. The challenge was to make the quiz fully accessible for users with disabilities while keeping it engaging, informative, and responsive.
