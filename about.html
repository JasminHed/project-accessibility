      <h2> Introduction to our team</h2>
      <p>We are a team of designers and developers, who believe that accessibility should not be a feature — but a
        foundation. Whether you're new to the topic or already passionate about inclusive design, we hope this helps you
        see things from new perspectives — and inspires you to build with empathy, for everyone.
